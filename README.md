# Automobile Data Analysis (Minor Machine Learning Project)

## 📘 Project Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly analytics assignment focused on exploring and visualizing an automobile dataset using Python. The goal is to extract insights from the data using `pandas` and basic plotting libraries.

**Dataset Source:**  
[Automobile CSV Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arora123/Data/master/Automobile_data.csv)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Import and clean the automobile dataset
- Identify and handle missing values
- Analyze and answer the following questions:

  1. Which are the cars with minimum or maximum price?
  2. How many cars are there with different body-styles?
  3. What is the average price of all body types of cars? (in descending order)
  4. What is the average price of cars by different companies? (in descending order)
  5. Count of car types having different numbers of cylinders
  6. Visualize the data for deeper insights
